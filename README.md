# ELDO - Autonomous Video Editor

ELDO is an autonomous video editing platform designed to streamline video marketing campaigns by automating content creation, scheduling, and publishing based on predefined brand identities and current campaign goals.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Brand Identity Recognition**: Automatically aligns video production with your brand's visual and messaging standards. Brands can be corporate or personal.
- **Smart Media Library**: Organize your media into evergreen or expiring content. Upload videos and when creating new content it will automatically use clips from associated media. Media are predominantly videos, but notes, blog posts, pdfs, presentations and images are also supported.
- **Campaign Automation**: Create and manage marketing campaigns with individual goals. For each campaign, Eldo will generate series of messages, and create and schedule content across various channels.
- **Autonomous Publishing**: Publishes content automatically according to the campaign schedule, a schedule which is refined based on optimal engagement predictions.

## ## Backend Functionality

Located in the `backend` folder, our backend is crucial for processing various types of inputs into polished video content. Here are the current capabilities:

- **Arxiv2Video**: Converts academic papers from ArXiv into engaging summary videos.
- **Technical Blog Post 2 Video**: Transforms technical blog posts into informative videos.
- **Event Promo Video**: Creates promotional videos for events using provided details.
